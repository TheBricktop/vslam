  - you can buy it from Springer or also authors give out pdf for free on github

  - On top of VSLAM, it has awesome introduction to all the geometry needed,
  so it's very useful for learning rendering as well.

- What seems to be SOTA (ish?) as of early 2023
  - https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3 - no DL indoor VSLAM
    - messy & complex C++ codez, sure to contain many bugs. 
      - Master branch dead on arrival (lol!), has many forks that start with fix for that.

  - near VSLAM, there live similar fields, such as SfM, augmented reality

  - Web version of a physical book. Thanks, Gabriel for making it available for free!
  - It is less complete then "Intro to VSLAM", but it has
    post-per-problem posts, which are very clear and solution oriented.
    - E.g. it gives complete solution to triangle clipping problem.

  - Nice web book about rendering and computer graphics. Very grateful to authors.
  - Some posts are a bit unfinished? Rambling / no direction ? No unified notation across posts?
